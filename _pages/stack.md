This site is built as a professional static project using modern DevOps tools for versioning, deployment, and maintainability.

---

### ⚙️ Technologies

- **Jekyll**  
  A static site generator widely adopted in DevOps environments, customized with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

- **GitHub Pages**  
  Fully integrated hosting for static websites, ideal for technical documentation and version-controlled personal sites.

- **Git + GitHub**  
  Full version control over code, configuration, and content. Every change in the `main` branch is automatically published.

---

### 📦 Site Structure

- `_config.yml`: site-wide configuration
- `_pages/`: custom pages like “About”, “Projects”, and “Blog”
- `_posts/`: blog content in Markdown format
- `_data/navigation.yml`: main site navigation
- `assets/images/`: visual assets like avatar and diagrams

---

### 🚀 Deployment

- **Automatic via GitHub Pages**  
  No infrastructure required. Every push to `main` triggers a live rebuild and deployment.

- **Local validation**  
  I use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview changes before pushing them live.

---

### 🔒 Best Practices

- Clean and maintainable configuration
- No unnecessary external dependencies
- Static assets organized by purpose
- Deployment without root access or external hosting platforms

---

### 💡 Philosophy

> “Simplicity, transparency, and full control over every change.”

This stack reflects how DevOps principles can be applied even to personal projects—minimal infrastructure, efficient automation, and full traceability.
