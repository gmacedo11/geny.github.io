**Introduction**

When people talk about CI/CD, they often assume modern tooling, cloud-native platforms, and teams that are eager to evolve. But in reality, many organizations still operate with **manual processes, siloed teams, and resistance to change**.

I’ve had the opportunity to introduce CI/CD practices in environments where **nothing was automated**, deployments were manual and risky, and DevOps was more a buzzword than a practice. Here’s what I’ve learned.

---

### 💥 Challenge 1: Resistance to Change

One of the hardest parts isn’t writing a Jenkinsfile or configuring GitLab — it's **people**. Teams that have operated the same way for years may view automation as a threat.

**What worked**:
- Start small: automate one part of the process (e.g., testing).
- Show value fast: reduce deployment times, catch errors earlier.
- Communicate: explain how automation empowers, not replaces.

---

### 🔒 Challenge 2: Lack of Trust in Automation

In manual environments, people rely on visual checks, spreadsheets, and "tribal knowledge." Handing that control over to a pipeline often feels unsafe.

**What worked**:
- Implement **staged pipelines**: build > test > deploy-to-staging > approve > production.
- Provide visibility: clear logs, status dashboards, and rollback plans.
- Document everything: reduce fear by showing predictability.

---

### 🏗️ Challenge 3: Legacy Infrastructure and Tools

No Docker. No cloud. On-premise VMs with outdated software. Trying to fit modern CI/CD tooling into that world is rough.

**What worked**:
- Build wrapper scripts around existing deploy methods.
- Use tools that support legacy (e.g., Ansible, custom shell jobs).
- Migrate piece by piece, not all at once.

---

### 🤝 Challenge 4: Siloed Teams

CI/CD requires dev, QA, and ops to **collaborate**. But in traditional environments, those teams often don’t talk — or worse, blame each other.

**What worked**:
- Create shared pipelines and review them together.
- Establish shared definitions of “done”.
- Celebrate successes cross-functionally (e.g., “We shipped in 2 hours instead of 2 days!”)

### 🧠 Takeaways

Implementing CI/CD from zero isn’t a tooling issue — it’s **organizational change**. But small, consistent progress builds credibility. When people see the benefits (fewer bugs, faster releases, less stress), resistance fades.

If you're introducing CI/CD in a resistant environment, **start where you are**. Automate one step, communicate often, and bring people along the journey.
